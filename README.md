# PythonLiveProject
For two weeks my Team Mates and I worked on creating  Apps with Django.We each were responsible for our own Applications so I focused my time on building an App where you could store and update characters for your D and D campagin. I also utilized Beautiful Soup for web scrapping to link relevant articles. Below is an overview of what I accomplished over the project, and at the very bottom is a look at the apps current state. 
# Starting my app and setting up the base model:
For Story 1 I set up the basic structure for my app creating templates with Django. I utilized Django templating language to maintain a constant style throught the project. I had to use [url paths](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/urlpatterns.png) and views based functions to render the different pages of the application. 
# Implementing crud functionalities:
In story 2 I created [The Data Base Model](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/DBmodel.png) and added the ability to create a [character](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/views1.png) in the database. For story 3 I created an [Index page](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/index.png) to display all characters entered into the database. I used the inbuilt django paginator class to create pagination for viewing the database entries. In Story 4 I added the functionality to [inspect](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/detailspage.png) each entery. In Story 5 I added the ability to [edit](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/editpage.png) and [delete](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/views2.png) any database entery. Durning these steps I was using sqlite db and django queries to interact with the DB.
# Beautiful Soup:
During story 6 and 7 I utilized a [web scraper](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/views4.png) to pull article summarys and their authors from dnd.wizards.com and rendered it on my articles page. In the future I would like to add direct links to the full articles and display the images attached to the articles.

Above are links to the app lay ouy. I utilized bootstrap and basic css for styling, in the future I would like to refine my look for the app.

# PythonLiveProject
For 2 weeks My Team Mates and I worked on creating  Apps with Django.We each were responsible for our own Applications so I focused my time on building an App where you could store and update characters for your D and D campagin.I also utlized Beautiful Soup for web scrapping to link relevant articles.
# Story 1 and 2:
For Story 1 and 2, I set up the basic structure for my app and created [The Data Base Model](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/DBmodel.png).
I also added the abiltiy to create a [character](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/views1.png) in the database.
# Story 3, 4 and 5:
For story 3 I created an [Index page](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/index.png) to display all characters entered into the database. In Story 4 I added the functionality to [inspect](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/detailspage.png) each entery. In Story 5 I added the ability to [edit](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/editpage.png) and [delete](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/views2.png) any database entery.
# Story 6 and 7(Beautiful Soup):
Here I utilized a [web scraper]() to pull article summarys and their authors from a web page and display them in my app. If I would have had more devlopment time I would have liked to add direct links to the full articles and display the images attached to the articles.

Above are links to the app lay ouy. I had a lot more to do in the way of styling but for my first project I am ok with it.

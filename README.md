# PythonLiveProject
For 2 weeks My Team Mates and I worked on creating  Apps with Django.We each were resposnbsble for our own Applications so I focused my time on building an App where you could store and update characters for your D and D campagin.I also utlized Beautiful Soup for web scrapping to link relevant articles.
# Story 1 and 2:
For Story 1 and 2, I set up the basic structor for my app and created [The Data Base Model](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/DBmodel.png).
I also added the abiltiy to create a [character](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/views1.png) in the database.
# Story 3,4 and 5:
For story 3 I created an [Index page](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/index.png) to display all characters entered into the database.
I also added the ability to [edit](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/editpage.png) and [delete](https://github.com/Driventobraise/PythonLiveProject/blob/main/views2.png) any database entery.
